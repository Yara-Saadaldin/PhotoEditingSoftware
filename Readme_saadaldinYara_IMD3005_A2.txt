Overview of what I did:
      I made an image editor that allows one to:
	- Adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation and colour balance levels of an image. 
	- Select a filter to apply to the image; that includes:
	- Black & White filter 
	- Sepia filter
	- Invert filter 
	- Edge detect filter 
	- Gaussian blur filter 
	- Sharpen filter 
	- Detect the RGB colour of the image when you click or drag the mouse on the colour that you want
	- Save the edited image
	- See changes made by comparing the image that is being edited to the original image
