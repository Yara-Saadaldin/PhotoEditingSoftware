Overview of what I did:
      I made an image editor that allows one to:
	- Adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation and colour balance levels of an image. 
	- Select a filter to apply to the image; that includes:
	- Black & White filter 
	- Sepia filter
	- Invert filter 
	- Edge detect filter 
	- Gaussian blur filter 
	- Sharpen filter 
	- Detect the RGB colour of the image when you click or drag the mouse on the colour that you want
	- Save the edited image
	- See changes made by comparing the image that is being edited to the original image



What was challenging:
	Saying that I struggled with one thing more than another would be unfair since I equally struggled with everything in this project. 
To say the least, this has probably been one of the most challenging programming projects that I have ever worked on. I have always been 
terrible at Maths and Physics and to combine that with programming is my worst nightmare!!! (On a positive note though: this project ended 
up being one of my most exciting and favourite programming projects that I have worked on (only after I got the hang of things)).

	When I first started this project, I spent the first two days, to say the least just trying to figure out how to do anything with not much work 
being done. It was difficult and confusing for me to understand the concepts. I was also overthinking things a little too much. Not to mention 
that I was not able to find any other resources online except for the lecture, and the way I learn is by looking at different ways that something
can be done so that things can stick better. (Another note: that was only at the beginning since I was searching for the wrong things / didn't 
know what to search).

	I ended up understanding the concepts and figuring out how to make things work at the end but one thing that I didn't get to do 
is increase or hide performance issues. Even though it is not a requirement, I wanted to do it but what happened was every time I attempted 
it, I would get errors so I left it. 



What went well:
	I can never thank you enough for the extension. Having more to work on this project helped ALOT. It gave me more time to grasp the
ideas, understand the concepts and experiment. 

 	After spending hours with no progress and making a lot of errors, things started to click. As that happened, I started figuring out what
and how to search for information online and found so many helpful resources online. Not to mention that I also decided to look at the
Openframeworks examples folder (which I don't know why I never did up until that time). 

	Finally getting things to work when you think that they'll never work is very exciting and rewarding. It is what kept me going and 
wanting to do more and more.

	Knowing my programming capabilities, I thought I would not be able to do half of the things that are required and I was ready to 
accept the fact that I am getting an F (not really but almost). Now, I can say that I did so much better than I could ever imagine. I got 
everything that I planned on doing work way better than I expected. I also learnt ALOT and enjoyed this a lot.
